# Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview
Create an Analysis of bike-sharing program in Des Moines to allow investors to identify whether a bike-sharing program would work for that city. TO do this analysis you will need to convert a CSV file into dataframe using Jupyter Notebook. You will then convert the file back to CSV to be analyized by Tableu

## Software Used
- Excel (CSV)

## Analysis

First we reviewed the average checkout time by users. We found that the avergae time a bike was checked out peaked at 5 mins and then steadily declined each minute afterwards.

Next we reviewed the average times by Gender. We found that Males tended to rent significantly more bikes that females.

We then create heat maps to identity the time sof the day that has the most usage. We found that 5pm-7pm were the optimal rnenting times during the weekday.

Next we created heatmap with a filter of Gender. The maps were consistent in showing that all genders still rented more bikes during the 5pm-tpm window.

## Summary

We found that the avg bike rental time was only 5 mins per session. We also were able to identify that Males were the most active users of the bike rental program. Marketing could be geared towards females help increase the total ride sharing numbers. Also we found that 5pm-7pm are optimal bike rental times. Bikes should be serviced and preparted prior to those times to ensure they are available for the most users.
